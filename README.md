# MicControl
A simple Mac OS Dock app to constantly control microphone level

Its useful if you use some video conferencing apps that adjust microphone level automatically and you can't turn that feature off. That's why I created it.

## Usage
Run the MicContro.app (I recommend copying it to your Applications folder). A dock icon of a microphone should appear.

Clicking the icon gives you four options:
- Enabled: true/false to enable microphone volume control
- A slider: to set the level you want the microphone enforced to
- Frequency: low/medium/high; the frequency you want the microphone to be enforced
- Quit to quit the app
